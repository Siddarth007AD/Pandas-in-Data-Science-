Data Wrangling with Pandas

 In this respo we do some operation of wrangling that data An important step for any data scientist is to prepare and clean the data so that it could be used later for deeper analysis. Analysis of raw and unclean data could lead to wrong insights which could derail the organization. Real 'raw' data needs a lot of 'wrangling' operations before it can be ready for dissection by a data scientist. One of the popular tools for data wrangling in python is pandas.

One of the reasons why Python is used extensively for Data Science is the availability of widespread packages for almost every possible function. The library pandas is one such package which makes life easier especially for data analysis through its extensive in-built functions for manipulations and visualizations. It is built on top of the NumPy and matplotlib library and one can harness the power of both these libraries in tandem with the power of pandas. Besides, there is huge community support especially for pandas and there are very high chances that you will get an answer for your query (if and when you get stuck) on the Internet. Take a look at the trend below to realize its popularity amongst users.
